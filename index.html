				<strong>february 2023 - july 2023:</strong> Microfluidics traineeship
				<p>Internship at the University "Magna Grecia" of Catanzaro concerning the design and realization of a passive micro-valve for microfluidic cellular screening devices. A microfluidic device, designed in Solidworks, with three-axis micro-milling CNC machine at the nanotechnology laboratory, was created. The microvalve was implemented in the aforementioned device and tested in the clean-room at the nanotechnology laboratory. A device for automatic temperature control in Arduino was also developed. Extensive use has been made at the same laboratory of optical microscopy, preheated hydraulic press and other manufacturing support instruments.
